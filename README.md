### [Live Demo](https://alexeystadnikov.github.io/tunein-exercise-ui/build/)

The application displays a list of radio-stations and gives opportunity to listen them online.

In the `config.json` you can configure the url of the stations list.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
